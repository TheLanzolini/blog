## Prelude

I was as hyped as anyone when Destiny was introduced as the next chapter in Bungie's Legacy. I enjoyed the Halo series as a casual fan, first being exposed to Halo:CE's free demo on the PC. It was one of my first FPS experiences. I was later exposed to Halo 2 and 3, but like my peers at the time, we fell into the sinkhole that was Call of Duty 4. I still played many hours of Halo 3 including the full campaign on Legendary. I paid little attention to the story like many kids my age, until one day I slowed down and listened. What is the Covenant? Who are the Flood? Why am I shooting them? I went back and started with Halo:CE's campaign to find myself playing with a completely different mindset. There was much more to Halo than shooting guns and sniper montages. There was a story behind it all.

I wanted to know more.

I had never chose reading over gaming before, but the Lore of Halo _actually_ drove me to pick up a book. I tore through the story, absorbing all I could about the Halo Universe. It empowered me to understand Halo: Reach and Halo: ODST as interactive narratives, instead of a mindless game of violence. A very stark contrast from the explosions of CoD: MW2 or the Meathead combat from Gears of War.

The developer that had fascinated me with a universe so beautiful and epic, had announced their next game: Destiny. I wasn't as hardcore as others, but I was seriously considering a console purchase to play it. (I was PC only at the time)

##### However, as soon as I saw the glacier white PS4 Destiny Bundle, I purchased it without hesitation.

## Initial Reaction

I remember the vanilla campaign as if Bungie forgot to include the second disc. Almost as if sections of the game were deleted or unfinished. No faction, character, or enemy was given an introduction throughout that entire experience. I kept waiting... and waiting... and waiting for _someone_ to explain _anything_ to me. Who are the Hive? The Vex? The Cabal? The Fallen? How did any of them get here? How did the Hive just dig into the moon without us stopping them? What exactly is the darkness? What about the Exos or the Awoken? All these factions for reputation without any explanation. Then you talk to the speaker who very much looks like the kind of guy to explain some shit.

#### OH YOU _COULD_ TELL ME OF THE GREAT BATTLE CENTURIES AGO? WELL GOOD. I GOT TIME MOTHERFUCKER.

Of course he doesn't.

Destiny left a lot of people saying: _**"That's it?"**_ There is nothing more? I expected more storytelling and immersion from Bungie. I expected there to be some character development or at least some characters in which develop. Every character was faceless, and every enemy was a nameless. (Pro Tip: Just because you put a yellow name above a generic enemy's head doesn't mean I give a shit about killing it) There was no character like The Arbiter to give us perspective, and there were barely any characters with personality. You only get a _tiny_ taste of a interaction with short cutscenes featuring _The Stranger_ and _The Queen_. We see both for a minuscule amount of time before we go back to fumbling in the dark, following the quest marker instead of following the plot.

Even though I wasn't told the story I was hoping for, I was still willing to stick it out and explore the rest of Destiny. I was met with the same exact strikes that I had already experienced, but with double the frustration. I tried moving forward with quests, but they were too hard for me to do solo and they weren't strikes so I couldn't matchmake to get help. I then tried the crucible only to get dunked on by players who had exotic gear. With both the PvE and PvP falling flat, I moved on.

<h2 id="actual_start">Coming back to Destiny</h2>

I compared Destiny to World of Warcraft when discussing the game with friends and peers. Destiny was more MMO than FPS in my opinion, but it was missing a lot of features that MMO's are known to have. Crafting, trading, and economy are good examples. Destiny worked without those usual MMO features, but it seriously lacked the main feature that makes and MMO, an MMO: **communication**. The clan system was bad and had to be accessed through the dang _web_ and there was no integrated system for finding or creating groups. There was no trade chat to communicate and discuss. It really lost the entire sense of community when you went to the tower to only see 15 or so people and none of them can say a damn thing. I was disappointed that nothing had changed on that front.

On the day Destiny 2 was announced, I bought the Destiny collection to go through all that I had missed. It had been 2.5 years and 4 expansions after all. This time I at least had friends to play with for a majority of the content. The experience already felt a lot better. However, the times in which I played solo felt just as shitty as they did with vanilla Destiny. I still couldn't do some Story Quests by myself, but at least the Strikes didn't feel like pouring bullets into a sponge for 30 minutes. There is much more content to play through casually. There are more than three strikes, they added a horde mode, and a bunch more maps for PvP. The end game content flows much better now. Once again I see a connection to WoW: you complete missions and strikes and slowly build up Light Level (synonymous to iLvl in WoW) to eventually get access to harder pieces of content which require higher Light Level. It adds progression into the end game instead of grinding repeatable content. Jumping into a Strike Playlist or a Crucible Match has much more variety than vanilla Destiny.

I had thought the DLC content was good enough to warrant another try, but then I was told how much all this DLC cost on release. $20 _EACH_ for The Dark Below and House of Wolves?? $40 Godamn dollars for the Taken King? $30 buckaroos for Rise of Iron? Even for Activision those prices feel steep. The price has gone down significantly as I bought _Destiny: The Collection_ for $40 which included the entire experience. _Destiny: The Taken King_ edition sells for $20 and includes all of the DLC except Rise of Iron. That is a pretty tough pill to swallow if you bought the DLC on release. $170 ($110 DLC $60 base game) dollars over 3 years isn't the worst deal for an MMO, considering an MMO like WoW charges 15 per month. All I can figure is that it must have felt shitty to pay that much for that such little content on release. I got the whole deal for $40 and I don't think I would have gave it another shot had the price been over $60.

_**The Dark Below**_ expansion didn't have a lot of presence. I played through the questline and did the strikes, but I didn't recall anything of consequence happening. Turns out a killed a big bad Hive dude who didn't _really_ die. I guess he had other plans to be killed in a raid encounter instead.

_**House of Wolves**_ felt just the same as vanilla and _The Dark Below_, except this time they added in a horde mode instead of a raid. The horde mode is nothing new considering a sizable part of the campaign was killing waves of enemies. It doesn't try anything drastic with the horde mode formula. You kill things and defuse bombs until you defeat the boss at the end. ðŸŽ‰

_**The Taken King**_ accomplished more in the first five minutes than the entireties of the past two expansions. Our Ghost had some _actual_ dialogue. We got voice actors with some real material to work with, and cutscenes with some weight. We had a villain to fight instead of "dude with yellow name". _The Taken King_ has more narrative in the first 30 minutes of gameplay than I experienced in the entirety of Destiny so far. The opening cinematic provided a very clear synopsis: "Big bad Hive dude who dun killed the Queen" (Maybe). I got a clear picture of who the characters were. I felt like I was meeting Zvala and Cayde for the _first time_. Their voiceovers were more than just giving instructions. They showed emotion through their words and refined their characters through their interactions. I couldn't tell you who Zvala _was_ before _The Taken King_, let alone what his personality was like. I'm sure _The Taken King_ was a breath of fresh air to Destiny fans. I had fun going through the story quests of this expansion. The questline felt like a true campaign story. It wasn't anywhere close to Halo, it was a lot better than before. Though the narrative was more on track, _The Taken King_ still did little to reveal the Hive's origins or illustrate the back story of Eris Morn. I suppose its too late to flesh out narratives for older DLC characters.

_**Rise of Iron**_ started off strong with an interesting opening mission and a badass cinematic. Rise of Iron's main storyline included a strong beginning and end, but totally forgot about the middle. Right as I was getting into the groove of killing some new enemies and picking up new gear, it was over. The whole big bad threat that I needed to stop surprisingly didn't do jack shit. The whole questline boils down to killing slightly stronger fallen who have armor. It is obvious that Rise of Iron was designed to provide enough end-game content to last for the next year until Destiny 2 releases. There is a bunch of content that you can progress through at the end-game level. Some playlists require higher Light Levels to complete, but there is a steady staircase of content that keeps strikes from being too easy.

## Quick Note on The Crucible

At the beginning, Destiny's PvP felt similar to Halo, but it felt off because of the multiple classes and abilities and exotic pieces. However, participating the crucible now felt way worse. I died many more times due to their class grenades and abilities than their weapons. When I did die to their guns it was very quick. The time to kill has gone way down. Every match was filled with Level 40/Light Level 400 players who had enough exotics to pick and choose. Getting killed by a homing rocket or being two shot by a hand cannon feels unfair when your weapons don't have as much impact. The combat seems like it would be more agreeable if I were at the level of the other participants. I couldn't imagine running into the crucible at a lower level I was. Even though they normalize gear stats, the bonuses you get from weapons and gear stay active. I understand the concept of player fantasy and it would break continuity to disregard your guardian's gear and weapons. I would like to see an improved system where everyone can feel competitive regardless of level or gear.

## What I hope for Destiny 2

In the wake of the Destiny 2 trailer, it seems they are embellishing their characters more. Highlighting Cayde-6 and Zvala as prominent figures in Destiny 2. In the aftermath of Destiny, Kotaku put together an <a href="http://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731" target="\_blank">article</a> explaining why Destiny was the way it was. Which leaves me to believe that the latter DLC's of Destiny weren't amazing due to their DLC production deadlines and constrictions of the engine they used. It gives me hope that Destiny 2 will not be lacking in the ways Destiny did in terms of narrative and aesthetic.

I hope they reveal the origins of the Factions we come in contact with. We barely know anything about the enemy races and why they are in our solar system. If the most they can give us is the grimoire, I would hope they would at make it available in game like Mass Effect does with its codex.

Apart from the _epic space opera_ like Halo I was hoping for, I _really_ hope that Destiny 2 embraces its MMO roots and implement more features MMO's have. If Destiny is only with fun with friends, then I wish they implement a better social features to enhance that fact. From the get-go of Destiny, Bungie has stated they were looking at feedback and planned for the future of Destiny. I hope they really listened and will make Destiny 2 the Destiny we have wanted.
